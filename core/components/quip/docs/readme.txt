This component is a simple commenting system. It allows you to easily
put comments anywhere on your site. It allows you to also manage them
via the backend management interface.


Upgrading to 0.6.0:
=====================
Note, the markup has changed for each comment. Comments are now no longer spaced
by margins, but in proper ol/li tags. If you'd like to revert to the old markup,
simply set &useMargins=`1` in your Quip call.


Please read the official documentation at:

Thanks for using Quip!
